### Task - 1 Create VM Images from Azure Marketplace

This step will focus more on creating VM Images from Azure Marketplace. 
There are other way to create VM Images though: 1) using existing Image in Azure Storage Account or 2) using existing image in local share on your cluster.
> make sure you have storage path already created (deployment on Lab 02 already created 2 storage path)
